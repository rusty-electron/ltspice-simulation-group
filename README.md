Simulator: ~~LTSpiceIV~~ LTSpiceXVII - [download link](https://ltspice.analog.com/software/LTspiceXVII.exe)
   * It is available only for Windows but it works fine using `wine` on Linux (tested on Linux Mint)

Reference Books:
   * Gayakwad (Opamps)
   * Boylestad (Analog circuits)

## Workplan

Here we list the steps involved in a weekly simulation exercise:

* First, we choose a chapter(s) from the reference books listed above, the reference books are chosen such that they contain dense information about the circuits and also contain information necessary for preparing a simulation in any standard circuit simulation tool.
    * We skip pure theory chapters from the books (but we do need the necessary context for understanding the intricacies of the circuits altough such chapters are not actively involved in simulations)
* We choose a circuit from the book, at the start of the week each member chooses a circuit from the chapter chosen in previous step.
* We simulate the circuit in LTSpiceXVII
* Towards the end of the week, We prepare a 1-page report that contains the details of the circuit as well as important information involved in preparing the simulation that can help while replicating it. This report is then peer-reviewed by another member.

* We also aim to post a simulation tutorial on [medium.com](https://medium.com), the timing of this task is flexible.
    * [ ] TODO: prepare a format for blog articles

> Seeking Simulation help is allowed during the week, other members can then assist him/her via screen-sharing or tool tips.

### Submission format

Place the Week X's files in the directory `./weekX` under the naming format `<username>-weekX.pdf`. Hence, if my username is `badbox4` and I am submitting for week3, the report file should be place under the directory `week3` as `badbox4-week3.pdf`.

## Week-wise schedule

* Week 1: Opamp with -ve feedback (first five chapters of Gayakwad) - completed
* Week 2: Frequency Response and General Linear Applications of Opamps
